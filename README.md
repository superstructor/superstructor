## What I'm Building

### [great.sh](https://great.sh) · *The managed AI dev environment*
One command. 16 AI agents. Fully configured. Open source.

The great.sh Loop is a 16-role AI agent orchestration methodology built on Claude Code: requirements, specs, adversarial review, codebase scouting, building, testing, security audits, performance checks, code reviews, UX inspections, visual reviews, documentation, and observation. Type `/loop` and it runs the full development cycle.

Also ships MCP server management, encrypted credential vaulting, cross-machine sync, and a declarative `great.toml` config format.

`Rust` · `Claude Code` · `MCP` · `Agent Teams` · `Apache 2.0`

### [Architecton.ai](https://architecton.ai) · *Productised solutions architecture* · Building
From idea to production blueprint, powered by AI. Template marketplace for great.sh environments.
