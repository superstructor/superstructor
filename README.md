## \#energyhacker

An Energy Hacker is someone who uses creative and innovative techniques to help other people increase energy efficiency via the provision of tools, resources and training in the form of media, software or hardware.

Energy Hacking can be used in a variety of ways, from improving the energy efficiency of homes to using alternative energy sources such as solar. One of the most common ways to hack energy is to make homes more energy efficient. This can be done in a number of ways, such as insulating the home or installing energy efficient appliances.

#energyhacker is a community of Energy Hackers who serve others by helping them increase energy efficiency, saving them money on their energy bills and by extension reducing their emissions tax liabilities. Energy Hacking is about using technology to make energy use more efficient.

It can be as simple as using a more efficient light bulb or as complex as installing a solar panel system integrated with artificial intelligence. Using alternative energy sources, such as solar power, wind energy or micro-hydro is a great way to increase energy efficiency while being protected from energy price rises and carbon emissions taxation. Energy Hacking is a great way to become wealthy in a life of fulfilling purpose by helping others save money and increase energy efficiency.
